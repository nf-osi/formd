### Transparent Governance

This form provides a mechanism for data contributors to _**acknowledge** and **help specify**_ how we will apply governance to your data.
In effect, these options will apply constraints on _**how**, **when**, and **to whom**_ your data will be made available.
You can help describe the most appropriate governance configuration for your data, balancing reuse with necessary protections. 

**This form can be updated as necessary before the data Release Date**, e.g. you may need to update the terms in acknowledgment or delay the date of data release. 
We will always contact you *before* the data is released on our platform to confirm these settings.

Note that there might already be *highly recommended* defaults, which are imposed by **funder expectations** or **community norms**. 
A yellow background indicates where a default have been already defined.
You are not expected to change these unless other conditions override the default. 

A blue background indicates the most commonly configurable options, and where your input on some data use constraints might be most important. 

### Data Release and Acknowledgments

**Release Date**

The release date is generally calculated as the date after the embargo period.  
`r RIA(.F$gov_ReleaseDate)`

**Acknowledgments**

Please indicate any acknowledgment and/or citation statement(s) required for publications resulting from use of the data.

`r RIA(.F$gov_Acknowledgments)`
